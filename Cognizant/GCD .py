# or the Greatest Common Divisor is the greatest number that exactly divides both numbers.

# Example:-

# The G.C.D of 24 and 40 is 8.

# The G.C.D of 18 and 12 is 6



# num=2
# n1=10
# n2=41
# m=min(n1,n2)
# for i in range(1,m+1):
#     if n1%i == 0 and n2%i == 0:
#         gcd=i
# print(gcd)

import math
a=math.gcd(22,48)
