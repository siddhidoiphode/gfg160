# Problem statement-: Elliot made a KeyLogger for his friend Romero, so that he can see the passwords of his friend. Keylogger is a software that can tell you the buttons pressed in the keyboard without the consent of the user, and hence unethical. Elliot made it to hack Romeroâ€™s passwords. The one problem is, Romero writes the passwords in lowercase characters only, and the keylogger only takes the values of the keys. Like, for a it takes 1, for b 2, and for z 26. For a given number Elliot produces all combinations of passwords in a dictionary and starts a dictionary based password attack. For a given number, print all the possible passwords in a lexicographic order.

# Input Format:

# One line, denoting the value given by the keylogger
# Output Format:

# All possible combinations of keyloggers in new lines are lexicographically ordered.
# Constraints:

# 2<=Number of digit in input<=1000
# Sample Input:

# 1234

# Sample Output:

# abcd

# awd

# lcd

# Explanation:

# For 12, you can take 1,2 that is ab, or you can take l.\\
