# Problem statement-: Elliot made a KeyLogger for his friend Romero, so that he can see the passwords of his friend. Keylogger is a software that can tell you the buttons pressed in the keyboard without the consent of the user, and hence unethical. Elliot made it to hack Romeroâ€™s passwords. The one problem is, Romero writes the passwords in lowercase characters only, and the keylogger only takes the values of the keys. Like, for a it takes 1, for b 2, and for z 26. For a given number Elliot produces all combinations of passwords in a dictionary and starts a dictionary based password attack. For a given number, print all the possible passwords in a lexicographic order.

# Input Format:

# One line, denoting the value given by the keylogger
# Output Format:

# All possible combinations of keyloggers in new lines are lexicographically ordered.
# Constraints:

# 2<=Number of digit in input<=1000
# Sample Input:

# 1234

# Sample Output:

# abcd

# awd

# lcd

# Explanation:

# For 12, you can take 1,2 that is ab, or you can take l.\\

digits="1234"
alpha = { str(i): chr(96+i) for i in range(1,27) }
print(alpha)
n=len(digits)
result = []

# alpha = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p','q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z']
# nums =  [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5, 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ,12, 13, 14 ,15, 16 ,17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]

# x='1234'
# y=list(x)
# print(y)
# row=''
# for i in y:
#     if int(i) in nums:
#         ind=nums.index(int(i))
#         row+=alpha[ind]

# print(row)

# for i in range(len(x)):
#     ele = x[i:i+2]    
#     if ele in x:
#         print(row[])
#     print(ele)
